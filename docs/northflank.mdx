title: Deploy on Northflank
---

Deploy Moltbot on Northflank with a one-click template and finish setup in your browser.
This is the easiest “no terminal on the server” path: Northflank runs the Gateway for you,
and you configure everything via the `/setup` web wizard.

## How to get started

1. Click [Deploy Moltbot](https://northflank.com/stacks/deploy-moltbot) to open the template.  
2. Create an [account on Northflank](https://app.northflank.com/signup) if you don’t already have one.  
3. Click **Deploy Moltbot now**.  
4. Set the required environment variable: `GATEWAY_PASSWORD`.
5. Click **Deploy stack** to build and run the Moltbot template.
6. Wait for the deployment to complete, then click **View resources**.
7. Open the Moltbot service.
8. Open the public Moltbot URL and access the Control UI at `/moltbot`.

## What you get

- Hosted Moltbot Gateway + Control UI
- Persistent storage via Northflank Volume (`/data`) so config/credentials/workspace survive redeploys

## Next Steps

Once deployed, log in to the Control UI using your `GATEWAY_PASSWORD` to finish configuring your agent.
