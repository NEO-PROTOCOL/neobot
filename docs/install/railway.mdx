title: Deploy on Railway
---

Deploy Moltbot on Railway with a one-click template and finish setup in your browser.
This is the easiest “no terminal on the server” path: Railway runs the Gateway for you,
and you configure everything via the `/setup` web wizard.

## Quick checklist (new users)

1) Click **Deploy on Railway** (below).
2) Add a **Volume** mounted at `/data`.
3) Set the required **Variables** (at least `GATEWAY_PASSWORD`).
4) Enable **HTTP Proxy** on port `8080`.
5) Open `https://<your-railway-domain>/moltbot` to access the Control UI.

## One-click deploy

<a href="https://railway.com/deploy/moltbot-railway-template" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Deploy on Railway</a>

After deploy, find your public URL in **Railway → your service → Settings → Domains**.

Railway will either:
- give you a generated domain (often `https://<something>.up.railway.app`), or
- use your custom domain if you attached one.

Then open:

- `https://<your-railway-domain>/moltbot` — Control UI

## What you get

- Hosted Moltbot Gateway + Control UI
- Persistent storage via Railway Volume (`/data`) so config/credentials/workspace survive redeploys

## Required Railway settings

### Public Networking

Enable **HTTP Proxy** for the service.

- Port: `8080`

### Volume (required)

Attach a volume mounted at:

- `/data`

### Variables

Set these variables on the service:

- `GATEWAY_PASSWORD` (required)
- `PORT=8080` (required — must match the port in Public Networking)
- `CLAWDBOT_STATE_DIR=/data/.clawdbot` (recommended)
- `CLAWDBOT_WORKSPACE_DIR=/data/workspace` (recommended)
- `GATEWAY_TOKEN` (recommended; treat as an admin secret)

## Backups & migration

Download a backup via the Control UI or CLI.

This exports your Moltbot state + workspace so you can migrate to another host without losing config or memory.
